# Gesture-Detection

I'm a student tying to go for Data Science Major. I have been practicing making some small projects to hone my skills.

Created a real-time hand gesture recognition project using OpenCV and MediaPipe. It uses a webcam to detect and track hand movements, then identifies different gestures like Hi, Peace, Help, Danger and also detects the face of the person heling to point I(yourself). This can be used in interactive applications like controlling devices with hand signals. Moreover helping non-physically inclined people to communicate easily. 

This project is of gesture detection for the YSS competition.

NO ML is used in this project the coordinates are mapped out to make a basic level project.

The modules used are:
tkinter
pillow
subprocess 
os
cv2
mediapipe
numpy

main.py was created to showcase a simpler and attractive project without showing others the code behind.
