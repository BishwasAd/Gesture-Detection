# Gesture-Detection
I'm a student tying to go for Data Science Major. I have been practicing making some small projects to hone my skills.

This project is of gesture detection for the YSS competition.

NO ML is used in this project the coordinates are mapped out to make a basic level project.

The modules used are:
tkinter
pillow
subprocess 
os
cv2
mediapipe
numpy

main.py was created to showcase a simpler and attractive project without showing others the code behind.
